# Ishkur CP/M
An open source, modular CP/M distribution for the NABU computer. It is (will be) designed to work with both cloud based and local storage options. It is still very much a work in progress.

This project will make use of ZASM's ability to do #includes, this may need to change if this is to build locally on CP/M itself.
